# Diabetes-Prediction
This project provides an easy-to-use web application for predicting whether a patient is diabetic based on health metrics using a trained machine learning model. The app is built with Streamlit, and the model is trained and saved using scikit-learn. Users can input features like glucose level, BMI, age, and more, and receive real-time predictions.
